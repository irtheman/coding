I was just wondering about integrating the HTML5 canvas into my Software Design blog like 
I did with JavaScript last week. Canvas is still basically JavaScript with a Canvas element.

<canvas id="canvas" width="400" height="400" style="background-color:#555">
Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.</canvas>

I saw this clock as a demo a long time ago and I was happily able to reproduce it.
<script>clock();</script>
