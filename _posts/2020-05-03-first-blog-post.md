This is my very first blog post -- ever! I'm very excited!

Some things I need to remember:

- This blog is using [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) for markdown
- It supports [MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html)
- The free [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free) provides some great icons
- This blog uses both "category" (i.e. creates a folder name  work, demo, etc)  and "tag" (i.e. labels a post with  C#, Java, algorithm, etc)  so make good use of them

Let's see this come to life!
