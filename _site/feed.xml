<p>If, like me, you have been applying for jobs, tailoring your resume multiple times to better fit the job description can get tiring. But aren’t we still unsure how effective it really is? I’m worried what questions the interviewer will ask about on my resume.</p>

<p>In today’s crazy competitive job market, making a resume that stands out is important. Tools like Ollama and Langchain offer nice useful AI models and tools that can not only be used to enhance your resume but also to prepare you for interviews.</p>

<h3 id="large-language-models-llms">Large Language Models (LLMs)</h3>
<p>These are tools with which you may have interacted with through ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude or whatever. To use these to update a resume to get a better job we have to instruct, or prompt, them carefully. For me, it is best to make the prompt by role, task, input, and output method.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Define the role it is supposed to mimic, define its task in detail, tell what sort of inputs it should expect, and how it should give the results.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve decided to take this a step further and develop my own application for my resumes.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>For this application, I use the Llama3 model from Ollama with python and Langchain. Basically, this application will do these things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read the job description provided</li>
  <li>Read your PDF resume</li>
  <li>Answer your questions based on your job description and resume</li>
  <li>Suggest modifications to your resume</li>
  <li>Do a mock interview</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of only working through the terminal, which I often do, I integrated streamlit into the AI Resume Chat application for an easier user interface.</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p><img src="/images/resume-ui.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first entry, the job description, will be a part of the system prompt itself. It is because all of the conversations will be dependent on it.</p>

<p>The second entry, a PDF resume, is the next part of the system prompt. RAG gets us the required snippets from the uploaded resume and, based on these, the application can extract relevant parts of the previous chat history which may be required. All of this is provided to the LLM which gives us its insights.</p>

<p>The third entry, a drop down, allows the selection of a chat option:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced Resume</li>
  <li>Simulate Interview
Both options have their own prompt, one to help enhance a resume and one to conduct an interview based on the job description and the provided resume.</li>
</ul>

<p>After clicking the Update button the model is loaded with all of the necessary provided information. When the model is ready a new entry appears when the user can ask any questions like “How can I change my resume for this job description?”, “What is wrong with my resume?”, or “Hello! Let’s start the interview please.”</p>

<p>If you want to use it then please visit the GitHub repository and apply the directions in the README.md file. All of this assumes you have knowledge of using python.</p>

<h1 id="data-redaction">Data Redaction</h1>

<p>The term for removing private information from code is data redaction. This technique involves masking or obscuring sensitive data within a document or dataset to protect personally identifiable information (PII) and other confidential data. Additionally, the process of hiding or removing sensitive information from documents is referred to as document redaction.</p>

<h3 id="some-traditional-methods">Some Traditional Methods</h3>
<p>Let’s say we have a docker compose for a complex set of services or maybe a python program for running an AI model. We want to share the code but, we don’t want to share our local information like the internal servers being used, their ports, the website domains, user names, passwords, contact information, or more.</p>

<p>I won’t bother explaining docker compose yaml files and their .env and secret files but they are the  best solutions. For docker compose one would use the .env and secret files that are then placed in the .gitignore file so they don’t get deployed. The .env, though in the .gitignore file, can be replaced with an uploadable example like ‘example.env’ so the one using the code can see what they need to provide. The same applies for the secret files, the secret file can have an uploadable replacement like ‘example.db_root_password.txt’. Documentation is very important.</p>

<p>For an application, like for python, one might use environment variables and document what they should look like so the one using the code can know what they need to complete. A simple script to launch the python application can include those environment variables like this but excluding the launching script using .gitignore…</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="c"># File: launch.sh</span>

<h3 id="my-custom-cover-all-redaction-method">My Custom Cover-All Redaction Method</h3>
<p>I personally have been using a custom bash script that just goes through every folder and file in the repository replacing anything private with something else. The whole redaction process can be undone using the same script. All the private information is kept in a ‘private-information.txt’ file that is never in any repository. This way all the private information is in one place and before any commit, using a git pre-commit hook, everything gets redacted.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="c"># File: .git/hooks/pre-commit</span>

  /scripts/replace.sh ../../
<span class="k">fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The information used by search.sh and replace.sh is in the ‘private-information.txt’ file. All search and replace goes in the order of the longer string to be replaced down to the smaller string to be replaced so the longer one gets matched first.</p>

<p>One will notice that I am using an equal sign as a separator in this example. If one wants to use this script, just use a character not likely to be redacted like a whitespace or control character i.e. \r, \n, \v, etc</p>

<p><a name="private-information"></a>
Here is an example of what the private-information.txt file would look like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>amigo.lan=MyPc1.local
hermano.lan=MyPc2.local

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty simple, right? The whole point is to always cover anything that needs to be redacted with the ability to undo the redaction when needed. Let’s say one has all their repositories in one ‘repos’ folder. Every repository can then be kept redacted by running this script at any time.</p>

<p>What are these search and replace scripts I’m talking about? See ya in the next post!</p>

<h1 id="data-redaction-search-script">Data Redaction Search Script</h1>

<p>One of the things I like to do when it comes to data redaction for my repositories is to check for any private information. I have this bash script called ‘search.sh’ that will search the whole folder for any private information. The script can do the opposite as well, searching for redacted information.</p>

<p>Please take a look at <a href="https://blog.matthewhanna.net/data-redaction#private-information">Data Redaction</a> for the ‘private-information.txt’ that will be used here.</p>

<p>For this script, since my repositories are always the same layout I define some bash variables that are easy to update. Please excuse the bad naming; they’ve been there for years.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># SECRETS is the file containing patterns to search for</span>

<h1 id="data-redaction-replace-script">Data Redaction Replace Script</h1>

<p>It’s time to take a look at the script that will replace the private information with the redacted information. The same script can undo that switch of information making it very convenient when storing code on a remote repository without making it private. This bash script is called ‘replace.sh’ and it will search the whole folder for any private information replacing it with the redacted version.</p>

<p>Please take a look at <a href="https://blog.matthewhanna.net/data-redaction#private-information">Data Redaction</a> for the ‘private-information.txt’ that will be used here.</p>

<p><strong>Sample run of search.sh</strong></p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Bad run...</span>
/scripts/replace.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Usage: /scripts/replace.sh [option] &lt;directory&gt;
Options:
  -s | --swap          Replace redacted with private
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Replace for private information with a redacted version</span>
/scripts/replace.sh ./

<span class="c"># Replace the redacted version with original private information</span>
/scripts/replace.sh <span class="nt">-s</span> ./
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For this script, I’m adding a bash variable while the others are just like in search.sh. They are easy to update this way. Again, please excuse the bad naming; they’ve been there for years.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># SECRETS is the file containing patterns to search for</span>
<span class="nv">SECRETS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"/private-information.txt"</span>
<span class="c"># EXD is a comma-separated list of directories to exclude</span>
<span class="nv">EXD</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"--exclude-dir={venv,.git,.vscode}"</span>

<span class="nv">EXEXT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"--exclude=*.{svg,webp,png,jpg,pdf,docx,gz,zip,tar}"</span>
<span class="c"># SED_SCRIPT is the temporary sed script file</span>
<span class="nv">SED_SCRIPT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"/tmpfs/script.sed"</span>

<p>This script uses the find command so we need to add the parameters to exclude the chosen directories and file extensions. I think it makes things easier to store the directories and file extensions to exclude in variables and then just generate what is needed for the find command.</p>

<p>This find command will be used like this…</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>find ./folder <span class="nt">-type</span> f <span class="se">\(</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="nt">-iname</span> <span class="s2">".png"</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="nt">-iname</span> <span class="s2">".zip"</span> <span class="se">\)</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="nt">-path</span> <span class="s2">"./venv"</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="nt">-path</span> <span class="s2">"./.git"</span> <span class="nt">-print</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To generate the directories to be excluded the following script is used:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Build the exclude paths</span>

<p>This script also is going to use the sed command. Using the sed script file is best in this situation but the file has to be generated. The sed command will make changes directly to the target file while making a backup before making that change.</p>

<p>The sed command will be used like this…</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># SED script file is, per line, like this...</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To generate the SED script file we have to read the ‘private-information.txt’ and transform it taking into consideration the swap parameter. SED does not do non-regex substitutions so there will be escaping added for both private and redacted.</p>

<p>Next, we just need to get the list of files that can be modified…</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Find files, filter for ASCII, and create an array of files</span>

<p>And that is it. I put both search.sh and replace.sh in a git pre-commit hook. These files only need to be changed when there is a new type of folder or file type to ignore when replacing private and redacted information.</p>

Data Redaction Replace Script It’s time to take a look at the script that will replace the private information with the redacted information.

This bash script is called ‘replace.sh’ and it will search the whole folder for any private information replacing it with the redacted version.

<p>Keeping in mind, this particular job had a specific rule of not allowing any third-party libraries. Everything had to be done adhoc.</p>

<h2 id="the-action-keeps-failing-challenge">The Action Keeps Failing Challenge</h2>
<p>While working with the team, I often found that tasks would fail due to other problems outside our domain. Often this was due to the SQL server timing out which we couldn’t change. There were sometimes problems where service we were relying on was slow starting up; all of our services would sleep after a mere 5 minutes.</p>

<p>We could just keep popping up the error notification and make the user resubmit but even I didn’t like doing that myself. I came up with an idea for going ahead and retrying until there was a definite point to give up.</p>

Everything had to be done adhoc. The Action Keeps Failing Challenge While working with the team, I often found that tasks would fail due to other problems outside our domain. Often this was due to the SQL server timing out which we couldn’t change. There were sometimes problems where service we were relying on was slow starting up; all of our services would sleep after a mere 5 minutes. We could just keep popping up the error notification and make the user resubmit but even I didn’t like doing that myself. I came up with an idea for going ahead and retrying until there was a definite point to give up. A Retry Function /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Retry a failed action /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name="action"&gt;Action to perform&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;param name="numberOfRetries"&gt;Number of retries&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;param name="delayMs"&gt;Delay between reties.

<h3 id="im-just-sharing-experiences">I’m just sharing experiences</h3>

<p>I’ve worked with many teams and my role was mostly as a helper and problem solver. This is what I actually enjoy about my work. Well, that and ETL.</p>

<p>In a new job, I discovered that there was no indication on the server as to what stage of deployment the project was in. Yes, each deployment went to a different server based on the git branch but there was nothing on the server saying what the environment was. This meant I couldn’t use the typical variety of AppSettings configurations. I found that even web.config was blocked on deployment. I asked if we could fix this and the CI/CD pipeline manager said he had no idea how to do that or why it would even be needed. He even advised just modifying the program.cs for each deployment.</p>

<div class="notice">
  <h4 id="note">Note</h4>
  <p>IIS servers do allow configuration of environment variables. An environment variable can also be configured using web.config if it isn’t blocked on the server.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="why-is-this-environment-variable-important">Why is this environment variable important?</h3>
<p>So, why would this matter? Well, environment variables, like <em>EnvironmentName</em>, can decide what the server environment is going to be like. This can also be used to determine what actions to take in that environment or even provide secret information only the server admin knows.</p>

<p>Like many already do, we should have had different AppSettings configurations to configure each application for it’s current environment. The AppSettings configuration can include things like the application version, what database to use for that stage, where to send the “error” warning email to, where to send the automated application emails, who is to be the initial administrator, where to store files locally, etc. Basically, up until I found a workaround, we had put everything into one appsettings.json for all stages and the project.cs code had to be modified for each deployment. What could go wrong with that?</p>

<p>My AppSettings suggestions were based on Microsoft’s Learning website…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>appsettings.development.json - A developers environment would be radically different as the developer would be using a different database (locally), they might want to disable the application emails being sent out, who the application admin was (the developer obviously), where to store the local files, and more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>appsettings.stage.json – The stage environment would be nothing like the developers environment but it should work just like the producation environment. It would of course have it’s own database, some emails might be different, and storing the files would be in a different place on that server.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>appsettings.production.json – The production environment would be like the stage environment only far more stable. The application server and the database servers should have been faster and more stable as well. Experiments should not have been happening in this environment because they would throw the user’s into appropriate tantrums.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>One of these AppSettings versions would be chosen based on the <em>EnvironmentName</em> environment variable.</p>

<h3 id="my-project-hack">My project hack</h3>
<p>I made a fun change to each of the projects so the proper AppSettings configuration would be used on deployment. It did take the team a while to adjust but the code got a lot cleaner and the deployments were more stable.</p>

<p>Here is the MSBuild modification I made:</p>

<p><strong>Something.csproj</strong></p>
<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="nt">&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;</span>

      <span class="nt">&lt;/Otherwise&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;/Choose&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>What is happening here is that, in <strong>GitBranch</strong>, I’m having MSBuild look for the .git folder and then read the HEAD file. Using the String.Replace() function, ‘ref: refs/heads/’ is removed leaving just the branch name. The branch name is trimmed and then stored in the <strong>GitBranch</strong> custom property.</p>

<p><strong>Choose</strong> is a feature MSBuild supports in csproj files and it lets the developer make a choice based on the property being used. In this project, ‘main’ was used for production, ‘develop’ was used for stage, and thus anything not ‘Release’ would be a ‘Development’ environment. The <strong>WhenCondition</strong> simply evaluates <strong>GitBranch</strong> and <strong>Configuration</strong> as strings and compares them to the conditions that should be met. When chosen, the <em>EnvironmentName</em> environment variable gets set. It is basically like a C# switch statement or expression.</p>

<h1 id="namecheap">NameCheap</h1>

<p>Some of my domain names are registered with NameCheap. Like my other registrars, I often use DDNS but NameCheap is a lot more difficult to keep the IP addresses up to date. Rather than use their provided application I made my own a long time ago because it was a fun challenge but I’ve decided to share my DDNS IP address updating script.</p>

<p>As a note, I also have been using an Asus router for many years now. They provide their own DDNS service with their own provider domain named ‘asuscomm.com’. It does come with it’s own SSL certificate also. You get to choose your own subdomain. As an example, mine could be ‘asus-ddns-subdomain’ giving me a final url like ‘asus-ddns-subdomain.asuscomm.com’. My ‘asus-ddns-subdomain.asuscomm.com’ url has the IP address assigned by my internet provider and Asus keeps it up to date. This is so very useful in a huge variety of ways which is one of several reasons I still use an Asus router.</p>

<h3 id="ddnssh-script">DDNS.sh Script</h3>
<p>The script I’m using is named ddns.sh and I keep it in my docker folder at /svr/docker so it is easy to find and edit when needed. This script will require the use of CRON but it will mostly only be run very quickly without sending any data back to NameCheap unless it becomes necessary.</p>

<h3 id="disable-echo">Disable Echo</h3>
<p>First I wanted to be able to turn echo off when it isn’t needed. I’m using the environment variable CRON as a flag to turn echo off. For echo, I’m using a variable that starts with the <strong><em>echo</em></strong> command and, if the CRON environment variable is there, the variable changes to “:” which just means “don’t do anything”.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"echo"</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="nt">-z</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$CRON</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then
  </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">":"</span>
<span class="k">fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="domains-and-subdomains">Domains and Subdomains</h3>
<p>The next step is to create two arrays, one for the root domains and the other for the subdomains. This has actually made it pretty easy to add new domains or subdomains and the CRON job doesn’t even have to be restarted.</p>

<p>Each array index is the root domain. On NameCheap, every domain has it’s own API Access Key for updating the IP address which is why the need for them to be included here.</p>

<p>Every subdomain, indexed by their own root domain, is also provided here in the script. For NameCheap, the subdomains don’t know the root domain’s IP address so they need to be set individually. Each subdomain here is separated by a ‘|’.</p>

<p>Please note, every subdomains element starts with ‘@’. This is the reference to the root domain itself. If you are using this script and have a domain that doesn’t have any subdomains, like ‘domain6.tld’, then you still need to provide the API key, of course, and the subdomains entry must, at the very least, have the ‘@’ listed and, in this case, no ‘|’ will be needed.</p>

NameCheap Some of my domain names are registered with NameCheap. Like my other registrars, I often use DDNS but NameCheap is a lot more difficult to keep the IP addresses up to date. Rather than use their provided application I made my own a long time ago because it was a fun challenge but I’ve decided to share my DDNS IP address updating script. As a note, I also have been using an Asus router for many years now. They provide their own DDNS service with their own provider domain named ‘asuscomm.com’. It does come with it’s own SSL certificate also. You get to choose your own subdomain. As an example, mine could be ‘asus-ddns-subdomain’ giving me a final url like ‘asus-ddns-subdomain.asuscomm.com’. My ‘asus-ddns-subdomain.asuscomm.com’ url has the IP address assigned by my internet provider and Asus keeps it up to date. This is so very useful in a huge variety of ways which is one of several reasons I still use an Asus router. DDNS.sh Script The script I’m using is named ddns.sh and I keep it in my docker folder at /svr/docker so it is easy to find and edit when needed. This script will require the use of CRON but it will mostly only be run very quickly without sending any data back to NameCheap unless it becomes necessary. Disable Echo First I wanted to be able to turn echo off when it isn’t needed. I’m using the environment variable CRON as a flag to turn echo off. For echo, I’m using a variable that starts with the echo command and, if the CRON environment variable is there, the variable changes to “:” which just means “don’t do anything”. echo="echo" if [ ! -z "$CRON" ]; then echo=":" fi Domains and Subdomains The next step is to create two arrays, one for the root domains and the other for the subdomains. This has actually made it pretty easy to add new domains or subdomains and the CRON job doesn’t even have to be restarted. Each array index is the root domain. On NameCheap, every domain has it’s own API Access Key for updating the IP address which is why the need for them to be included here. Every subdomain, indexed by their own root domain, is also provided here in the script. For NameCheap, the subdomains don’t know the root domain’s IP address so they need to be set individually. Each subdomain here is separated by a ‘|’. Please note, every subdomains element starts with ‘@’. This is the reference to the root domain itself. If you are using this script and have a domain that doesn’t have any subdomains, like ‘domain6.tld’, then you still need to provide the API key, of course, and the subdomains entry must, at the very least, have the ‘@’ listed and, in this case, no ‘|’ will be needed. declare -A domains declare -A subdomains domains["domain4.tld"]="random-namecheap-api-key-one" domains["domain5.tld"]="random-namecheap-api-key-two" domains["domain3.tld"]="random-namecheap-api-key-three" domains["domain6.tld"]="random-namecheap-api-key-four" subdomains["domain4.tld"]="@|www.|immich.|nextcloud.|collabora." subdomains["domain5.tld"]="@|www." subdomains["domain3.tld"]="@|www." subdomains["domain6.tld"]="@" IP Address Found From here, the script needs to know what the currently assigned IP address is.

<p>A schema needs to be shared. It is a way of saying "This is what we expect from our clients and what we will
deliver." Doesn’t this make life simpler rather than guessing around until something works?</p>

<p>Is this something new? Nope, even XML had schema. Do you remember XSL? There was a reason for that. Every
programming language out there has a "schema" as well.</p>

<p>In the above example JSON schema one should have noticed the "type" keyword. A JSON property can often be misinterpreted. "Is it a number? A string? An object? What do I provide?", would be some common questions.</p>

<p>In the schema, "type" specifies the JSON type that is accepted. Sometimes a producer / consumer can handle multiple types but we need to be specific.</p>

<p>Additional attributes can accompany a "type". For example, one could add ‘description’, ‘minimum’, ‘maximum’, ‘minLength’, ‘maxLength’, ‘pattern’, ‘format’ and more properties. Just stick to the standards one makes.</p>

<p>The JSON schema also includes annotations like ‘$schema’ <strong>(points to the type of schema being used)</strong>, ‘title’,
‘description’, ‘default’, ‘examples’, ‘$comment’, ‘enum’, ‘const’, ‘required’ and many more.</p>

<h2 id="non-json-data">Non-JSON Data</h2>
<p>To include non-JSON data one can also make use of the schema to clarify what is being passed around by using 
annotations like ‘contentMediaType’ and ‘contentEncoding’.</p>

<p>As an example, the proposed schema:</p>

Let’s have a look; if you are a learner this will push you forward… JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation", a simple data interchange format. There are lots of these data interchange formats but JSON is great for web development due to its strong ties to Javascript and, of course, Java. JSON Structure JSON supports the following data structures but they all have different interpretations in various programming languages: object: { ‘key1’: ‘value1’, ‘key2’: ‘value2’ } array: [ ‘first’, ‘second’, ‘third’ ] number: 42 3.1415926 string: ‘This is a string’ boolean: true false null: null What some people might expect with JSON: { 'name': 'John Doe', 'birthday': 'February 22, 1978', 'address': 'Richmond, Virginia, United States' } What JSON should look like: { 'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Doe', 'birthday': '1978-02-22', 'address': { 'home': true, 'street_address': '2020 Richmond Blvd.', 'city': 'Richmond', 'state': 'Virginia', 'country': 'United States' } } One of the JSON sample representations is better than the other. The first is quick and dirty while the second has a thought out structure. A schema makes the second one even better and easier to interpret when one could need to support multiple consumers or using various programming languages. This is an example of the JSON Schema for the second JSON sample. Note how it is still JSON also: { '$id': 'https://yoursite.com/person.schema.json', '$schema': 'https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema', 'title': 'Person', 'type': 'object', 'properties': { 'first_name': { 'type': 'string' }, 'last_name': { 'type': 'string' }, 'birthday': { 'type': 'string', 'format': 'date' }, 'address': { 'type': 'object', 'properties': { 'home': {'type': 'boolean' } 'street_address': { 'type': 'string' }, 'city': { 'type': 'string' }, 'state': { 'type': 'string' }, 'country': { 'type' : 'string' } } } } } Declaring a JSON Schema A schema needs to be shared.

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Polymorphism allows the expression of some sort of contract, with potentially many types implementing that contract (whether through class inheritance or not) in different ways, each according to their own purpose. Code <em>using</em> that contract should not have to care about which implementation is involved, only that the contract will be obeyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="single-responsibility-principle">Single Responsibility Principle</h2>
<p>SRP keeps classes simple, easy to maintain and minifies the effects of any minor changes. A class should only have one responsibility and not multiple. This can sound confusing at first; someone will likely bring up something like a view model or controller but that, in itself, has a single responsibility to manage other classes that themselves have a very simple single responsibility.</p>

<p>Again, OCP keeps classes simple, easy to maintain and minifies the impacts of changes to the code. OCP means that the class should not be modified (i.e. it is closed) but it can be extended (i.e. it is open). A developer will often say, “Hey, I need to add this new capability to this class for this specific case.” That modification can be reckless. One should keep the original class intact so the code relying on that original class isn’t broken. To add that new functionality the class basically has a new task and thus needs to change; that change should be an extension via inheritance.</p>

<h2 id="liskov-substitution-principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</h2>

<p>LSP keeps the overall program working as it was designed though a backing class might have been swapped out for another implementation. A good example of LSP in use is the Mock object often used in Unit Testing. The LSP object can be based off of interfaces or an abstract class as long as the object instance doesn’t break the calling code.</p>

<h2 id="interface-segregation-principle">Interface Segregation Principle</h2>

<p>ISP helps protect clients from developers damaging interfaces which are normally “contracts” with other clients. Interfaces used by other clients, including actual people or classes throughout your code repositories, should not change because that change could break the client’s software implementation. There is also the tendency to put too much stuff into an interface which can almost be seen as the same as violating the Single Responsibility Principle though from an interface perspective. Requirements matter and sometimes it is a good idea to break up a proposed interface to provide more flexibility.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-inversion-principle">Dependency Inversion Principle</h2>

<p>Instead of hard coding a class to determine what component should be used internally flexibility should be built in. With DIP we want to invert, or delegate, the responsibility of that swappable component used internally. As an 
example, instead of using a bunch of IF statements to choose your logging mechanism (that’s a no), or some flag in your logging class (that’s a no) or just becoming inflexible and not allowing for this kind of change one should use Dependency Inversion.</p>

Martin What is SOLID? Single Responsibility Principle Open / Closed Principle Liskov Substitution Principle Interface Segregation Principle Dependency Inversion Principle What is SOLID? SOLID is an acronym for the 5 basic principles of good software architecture: Letter Abbr Name Basic Description S SRP Single Responsibility Principle A class should have only a single responsibility, that is, it only has 1 specific task to fulfill. O OCP Open / Closed Principle A class that needs a new behavior should be extended and not modified. L LSP Liskov Substitution Principle A class should be replaceable by a subclass that can change how a task is completed but it doesn’t damage the operation of the dependent classes. In other words, a parent class should be able to refer to child objects seamlessly during runtime via polymorphism. I ISP Interface Segregation Principle Instead of one huge multi-purpose interface one should have multiple specific interfaces. A client should not be forced to code for an interface they do not need. D DIP Dependency Inversion Principle Implementation should depend on abstraction rather than some concrete solution. High level objects should not have to depend on low level objects; they only need to know the feature is implemented by something. Polymorphism allows the expression of some sort of contract, with potentially many types implementing that contract (whether through class inheritance or not) in different ways, each according to their own purpose. Code using that contract should not have to care about which implementation is involved, only that the contract will be obeyed. Single Responsibility Principle SRP keeps classes simple, easy to maintain and minifies the effects of any minor changes. A class should only have one responsibility and not multiple. This can sound confusing at first; someone will likely bring up something like a view model or controller but that, in itself, has a single responsibility to manage other classes that themselves have a very simple single responsibility. Broken - Writing to logfile is not job of Aggregator class. ___ class Aggregator { public void Add(Entity entity) { try { // Add entity to aggregator. } catch (Exception ex) { System.IO.File.WriteAllText(@"c:\Error.txt", ex.ToString()); } } } Fixed ___ class Aggregator { private Logger log = new Logger(); public void Add(Entity entity) { try { // Add entity to aggregator. } catch (Exception ex) { log.Error(ex.ToString()); } } } class Logger { public void Error(string error) { System.IO.File.WriteAllText(@"c:\Error.txt", error); } } Open / Closed Principle Again, OCP keeps classes simple, easy to maintain and minifies the impacts of changes to the code. OCP means that the class should not be modified (i.e. it is closed) but it can be extended (i.e. it is open). A developer will often say, “Hey, I need to add this new capability to this class for this specific case.” That modification can be reckless. One should keep the original class intact so the code relying on that original class isn’t broken. To add that new functionality the class basically has a new task and thus needs to change; that change should be an extension via inheritance. Broken ___ class Drone { public int DroneType {get; set; } public DateTime ArrivalTime(double kilometers) { if (DroneType == 0) { return DateTime.Now.AddHours(kilometers); } else if (DroneType == 1) { return DateTime.Now.AddHours(kilometers / 2.0); } else if (DroneType == 2) { return DateTime.Now.AddHours(kilometers / 32.0); } } } Fixed (Polymorphism Inheritance) ___ class Drone { public virtual DateTime ArrivalTime(double kilometers) { return DateTime.Now.AddHours(kilometers); } } class SpyDrone : Drone { public override DateTime ArrivalTime(double kilometers) { return base.ArrivalTime(kilometers / 2.0); } } class AttackDrone : Drone { public override DateTime ArrivalTime(double kilometers) { return base.ArrivalTime(kilometers / 32.0); } } Liskov Substitution Principle LSP keeps the overall program working as it was designed though a backing class might have been swapped out for another implementation. A good example of LSP in use is the Mock object often used in Unit Testing. The LSP object can be based off of interfaces or an abstract class as long as the object instance doesn’t break the calling code. Example - Substituting a logger class doesn’t break Aggregator ___ class Aggregator { // private ILogger log = new FileLogger(); private ILogger log = new ConsoleLogger(); public void Add(Entity entity) { try { // Add entity to aggregator. } catch (Exception ex) { log.Error(ex.ToString()); } } } interface ILogger { void Error(string message); } class FileLogger : ILogger { public void Error(string error) { System.IO.File.WriteAllText(@"c:\Error.txt", error); } } class ConsoleLogger : ILogger { public void Error(string error) { System.Console.Error.WriteLine(error); } } Interface Segregation Principle ISP helps protect clients from developers damaging interfaces which are normally “contracts” with other clients. Interfaces used by other clients, including actual people or classes throughout your code repositories, should not change because that change could break the client’s software implementation. There is also the tendency to put too much stuff into an interface which can almost be seen as the same as violating the Single Responsibility Principle though from an interface perspective. Requirements matter and sometimes it is a good idea to break up a proposed interface to provide more flexibility. Original ___ interface IDatabase { void Add(Entity entity); } class Client: IDatabase { public void Add(Entity entity) { // Add entity to database. } } Broken ___ interface IDatabase { void Add(Entity entity); Entity Read(); } // Broken! class Client: IDatabase { public void Add(Entity entity) { // Add entity to database. } } Fixed ___ interface IDatabase { void Add(Entity entity); } interface IDatabaseV1 : IDatabase { // Has Add Method. Entity Read(); } class ClientWithRead: IDatabaseV1, IDatabase { public void Add(Entity entity) { Client obj = new Client(); obj.Add(entity); } public Entity Read() { // Read from database. } } class Client: IDatabase { public void Add(Entity entity) { // Add entity to database. } } // Results... IDatabase a = new Client(); // Previous clients happy! a.Add(entity); IDatabaseV1 b = new ClientWithRead(); // New client requirements. b.Add(entity); entity = b.Read(); Dependency Inversion Principle Instead of hard coding a class to determine what component should be used internally flexibility should be built in. With DIP we want to invert, or delegate, the responsibility of that swappable component used internally. As an example, instead of using a bunch of IF statements to choose your logging mechanism (that’s a no), or some flag in your logging class (that’s a no) or just becoming inflexible and not allowing for this kind of change one should use Dependency Inversion. Broke 1 ___ class Aggregator { private Logger log = new Logger(); public void Add(Entity entity, bool logToFile = true) { try { // Add entity to aggregator. } catch (Exception ex) { log.LogToFile = logToFile; log.Error(ex.ToString()); } } } class Logger { public bool LogToFile { get; set; } = true; public void Error(string error) { if (LogToFile) { System.IO.File.WriteAllText(@"c:\Error.txt", error); } else { System.Console.Error.WriteLine(error); } } } Broke 2 ___ class Aggregator { private ILogger log1 = new FileLogger(); private ILogger log2 = new ConsoleLogger(); public void Add(Entity entity, bool logToFile = true) { try { // Add entity to aggregator. } catch (Exception ex) { if (logToFile) log1.Error(ex.ToString()); else log2.Error(ex.ToString()); } } } interface ILogger { void Error(string message); } class FileLogger : ILogger { public void Error(string error) { System.IO.File.WriteAllText(@"c:\Error.txt", error); } } class ConsoleLogger : ILogger { public void Error(string error) { System.Console.Error.WriteLine(error); } } Fixed ___ class Aggregator { private ILogger log; public Aggregator(ILogger logger) { log = logger; } public void Add(Entity entity, bool logToFile = true) { try { // Add entity to aggregator. } catch (Exception ex) { log?.Error(ex.ToString()); } } } interface ILogger { void Error(string message); } class FileLogger : ILogger { public void Error(string error) { System.IO.File.WriteAllText(@"c:\Error.txt", error); } } class ConsoleLogger : ILogger { public void Error(string error) { System.Console.Error.WriteLine(error); } } // Usage: Aggregator agg1 = new Aggregator(new FileLogger()); Aggregator agg2 = new Aggregator(new ConsoleLogger());]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CQRS</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/cqrs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CQRS" /><published>2020-10-06T16:27:25-04:00</published><updated>2020-10-06T16:27:25-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/cqrs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/cqrs/"><![CDATA[<p>CQRS is a Command, Query, Responsibility and Segregation design pattern.</p>

<p>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a powerful architectural pattern that seems to cause quite a lot of confusion; it breaks from the norms most developers cling to by segregating the read and write operations with interfaces (check out <a href="https://blog.matthewhanna.net/solid">SOLID</a> to see how this improves performance, connections, and maintenance). With the popularity of micro-services and the event-based programming model, it is important to know what CQRS is. This is a potentially good option for working with large complicated databases.</p>

<p>First, let’s make sure we are in agreement on what CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete), the old CQRS competitor, is. When one thinks about this, CRUD is what most basic software systems rely on. A developer has some records, they may want to read some records, update the records, create a new record or delete some records. If one wants to build a system, a reasonable starting point would be using the same model for retrieving object as well as updating objects. As an example, assume you want to write a “Video Store Application”. You may have a <em>VideoInventoryService</em> that lets you do things such as add new videos to the inventory, mark some of the videos as loaned out, check if there is a specific video, etc. That would be a very simple CRUD system.</p>

<p>In CQRS the goal is to segregate the responsibilities for executing commands and queries. This simply means that in a CQRS system, there would be no place for <em>VideoInventoryService</em> that is responsible for both queries and commands. You could have <em>VideoInventoryReadService</em>, <em>VideoLendingReadService</em> and maybe more. These services are broken down into separate responsibilities without concern for the other services. They will even run simultaneously meaning the micro-services don’t have to wait for a write or a read to finish. That is the job of the appropriate micro-service to finish it’s task while allowing others to continue.</p>

<p>From a desktop development world, or maybe even the monolithic services view, this does not sound like the most practical thing. And in some cases it may not be practical. How complex is your data source? Will breaking it down make development and maintenance easier?</p>

<p>Another aspect to keep in mind is that if the developers are employing an actual domain driven development practice then the CQRS system is made even more simple by only being concerned with it’s own specific domain. The purposes of the data driven micro-services become more simplified and the micro-services themselves no 
longer have to be concerned about details outside of their domain. Also, another nice thing about CQRS is there is no requirement for Event Sourcing. Commands are in effect streams of events that are persisted in the command part of the CQRS system. Queries only see and interpret these events once the data source is updated; no early peeks or corrupted data. In an event-driver distributed system like that seen in services or desktop applications there must be constant messages being passed around to keep changes orchestrated. Using the same domain 
model, or not separating these responsibilities, would be a mistake.</p>

<p>Finally, in summary, for most non-trivial systems it is not necessary to implement CQRS. In micro-services, the CRUD system is fine when the system’s purpose is very focused on a common task like instant messaging, creating a meme repository or maybe having a driving app. Adding complexity like a myriad of unrelated tasks, a complex multi-purpose database, or other trivial complications makes CRUD more difficult. The added complexity may end up detrimental to the system design. Plan carefully and be ready for the future.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="info" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[CQRS is a Command, Query, Responsibility and Segregation design pattern.
